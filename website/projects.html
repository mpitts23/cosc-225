        <h2>Titanic Kaggle Competition</h2>
        <p>
          Last year, I participated in a data science Kaggle competition as part
          of my Machine Learning class. I used tools such as random forests and
          support vector machines (SVMs) to predict which passengers survived on
          the Titanic. Many variables, like age, social class, and gender, were
          very significant predictors of survival.

        <h2>Using ARIMA and GARCH to model financial time series data</h2>
        <p>
          This is a project I completed as part of the capstone STAT-495 class.
          It has helped me learn common ways to model time series data.
        </p>
        <p>ARIMA stands for auto-regressive indifference moving average.</p>
        <p>
          GARCH stands for generalized auto-regressive conditional
          heteroskedasticity.
